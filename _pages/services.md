I offer freelance services in the fields of **design thinking, product design, UX/UI design, service design, frontend engineering and design engineering**. My previous [projects]({{ site.url }}) are the best reference to determine if I could be useful to advance your idea or product.

Product development is a broad term that starts with putting your organisation in a position to even conceive innovative ideas up to the moment you ship a product to market. As such, deliverables of my freelance engagements take different shapes. You can find a bit more detail at the bottom of the page.
