My name is Paolo and I create physical and digital tools, from concept to implementation â€“ as a **product designer, software developer and maker**. I am based in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland.

Having trained as a Design Engineer (MEng, Imperial College London), I have specialised in products that bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds. Amongst others, I've applied my skills in the robotics, IoT, medical technology or extended reality fields.

Broadly, I am interested creating tangible products that help people achieve a task instead of glueing them to the screen. You are warmly invited to have a look at my previous [work]({{ site.url }}) or see if any of my freelance [services]({{ site.url }}/services) match your needs.
