I work on the interface between people and technology. By developing new ways of interacting with our environment through intelligent systems, I aim to bring the two closer together. As technologies around us become more complex, efficient communication between the user and the product is becoming ever more important. I strive to develop products that are technically challenging, but feel natural to use. If you are looking for a freelancer within the field of interaction design and engineering, technology development or robotics, please feel free to contact me.
