Whenever we visit a new place, we rely on somebody or something to tell us how to get there. Nowadays, **our smartphones have taken over** and urban navigation happens almost exclusively through the use of location-based services such as Google Maps. There are two major issues with the overreliance on visual maps in urban navigation:

* It's dangerous. You cannot really read a map and observe other traffic or pedestrians at the same time. 
* It's annoying. If you are walking or cycling, you have to get your phone out of your pocket, for which you often have to stop and interrupt your journey. 

Sonav (working title) is **a navigation app that uses spatial audio to guide you to your destination** – without having to look at or even hold your phone. ​The guiding sound is chosen by the user and could be music from Spotify or audiobooks from Audible. In a nutshell, **your music guides you to your destination**. The app is designed with a minimalistic UI in mind and currently developed in Unity. The project's aim is to reduce the amount of required manual interactions that are needed to reach a destination. I am currently using the Mapbox and Movesense APIs to for map information and to achieve head tracking.
