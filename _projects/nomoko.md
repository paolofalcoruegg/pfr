Nomoko is a Zürich-based startup that is building the infrastructure for the fourth industrial revolution, which is all about **connecting the physical and the digital worlds**. The premise is that, in order to make digital applications interact with the world around us (e.g. using IoT or geospatial data), we need a **physically accurate digital** model of our environment. Nomoko is at the forefront of creating this digital twin by **3D-scanning cities with the use of drones** and then using AI to segment the data into vegetation, roads, buildings and more. This enables Nomoko to offer **the most complete digital representation of a city possible today**. Nomoko aims to be both the data provider as well as create tools and products that rely on this data, which is where I come into play.

I joined Nomoko as a **frontend engineer responsible for building applications on top of their city-scale, photogrammetric data sets**. Currently, I am developing **desktop (C#) and web (React.js) apps that allow customers from different fields to experience and gain value from our data**. My projects focus both on generic web applications as well as prototypes for specific business cases such as sensor data simulation for the autonomous vehicle industry. I am also involved with market validation pipelines, which means **making sure that the feedback we get from customers informs the specifications we use to design and build our future products**.
