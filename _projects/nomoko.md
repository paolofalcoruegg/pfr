**Note: The startup has evolved since my time working there. This is a recount of my journey there and how I was able to contribute. Learn more [on their website](https://nomoko.world).**

Nomoko is a Zürich-based startup that is building the infrastructure for the fourth industrial revolution, which is about **connecting the physical and the digital worlds**. The premise is that, in order to make digital applications interact with the world around us (e.g. using IoT or geospatial data), we need a physically accurate digital model of our environment. Nomoko is at the forefront of creating this digital twin by 3D-scanning cities with the use of drones. This enables Nomoko to offer the most complete digital representation of a city possible today. Since my time at Nomoko, the company has evolved quite a bit, so it is best to start with the video below, which illustrated the concept when I joined.

Nomoko wanted the bring the ideas presented in the video above to the real world using high-quality, photogrammetric data that it collects using drones. The data collection process is shown in the video below.

This is the point where I start to come into play. When building a product, one of the most important things is naturally what problem it is solving. I joined Nomoko as a **frontend engineer responsible for building applications on top of their city-scale, photogrammetric data sets**. On top of that, I was also involved in conducting UX research, running design sprint and translating research into product specs. During my time at Nomoko, we were trying to establish product market fit by prototyping and testing several use cases targeted at different industries. You can see a few of the applications that we investigated for Nomoko technology in the video below: 5G propagation, noise simulation, solar panel allocation, real estate visualisation or shadow analysis.

Based on our market validations, amongst others, Nomoko then decided to venture into the PropTech space. We started conceptualising the platform, which you can find [here](https://platform.nomoko.world/), and has evolved a lot since I left. I wish them all the best for the future!
