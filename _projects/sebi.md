I built this piece of furniture, because I moved to a new shared flat and I wanted to keep the communal spaces free when I was working. While I love being able to work from home, it's not so straight-forward if you don't have a designated room for it. In shared accomodation, you often end up in each other's way and then feel bad for expecting everyone to basically spend your workday with you. So I ended up mostly working in my room, because I don't really like the idea of occupying living spaces for work. It would be fine if everyone worked 9 to 5, but if you're not in sync or someone needs to work on the weekend, the home starts feeling busy constantly. Not a nice feeling. Anyway, when I had put a desk in my room, it always felt like there was just not enough space for it. That's where the need for this piece of furniture came from.

The build uses a bent metal frame and a machined wooden construction. The desktop pivots on the metal construction using a secretary band hinge and is held in place with magnets. While the desk doesn't collapse when used without the pole, I do use it when working, and was surprised to learn how often I put a lot of my body weight on the desktop. While I am very happy with the overall design, I really appreciate being able to close the desk when I am not using it â€“ physically shifting the purpose of my room back to that of a bedroom. And not always having to look at a turned off monitor, something which has always bothered me for some reason.
