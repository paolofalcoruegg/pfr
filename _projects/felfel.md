FELFEL is my latest attempt at a steady job. I took the role there as a Product Owner for customer-facing technology (Read on to understand what on earth this means). Shifting from development into a product role made sense for me, as I got really up with having no say in why I was developing something and what it was. In a sense, this is much closer to the creative part of studies that I enjoyed a lot.

On top of that, I wanted to get back to a tangible product – something I can touch and interact with. In short, I found the mix of technology, interaction design and user centredness very interesting. Finally, I liked that the actual product that our customers know us for is food and not technology.

FELFEL offers a healthy food subscription for organisations – in offices, hospitals or schools. The service consists of delivering freshly produced food on a daily basis to the FELFEL fridge. The food is exclusively produced by small, independent and mostly Swiss businesses. There is also a focus on sustainability and reducing food waste – most food that would be wasted is donated to Caritas.

At the core of the service is the FELFEL, which is the name of the fridge. My job is to make sure that people understand how to eat from the FELFEL. The goal is that this process is equally intuitive, easy and accessible for anyone. The problem is that making the experience as easy as opening your fridge at home is not possible. Literally a thousand things need to happen before you touch the food: We need to tell you how to open the fridge, how to open the fridge


e identify that someone wants to open the fridge, we need to know who you are (anonymously), we need to unlock the fridge, we need to check if you have a valid payment method, what you want to buy, how you want to pay, what is missing from the fridge now, what to refill.






The reason why this needs a dedicated person is because a lot of things need to happen so that someone

to make sure that the product works for our eaters in terms of user experience and technology. In order to buy food, you download our app which is sort of the key to the FELFEL. The rest is simply a matter of opening the sesame by means of either scanning a QR code on the app or using contactless login by holding your phone to the  FELFEL. Then you still need to scan your food and click pay – just like with a self-checkout machine.





The company is somewhat of a start-up with less than 100 employees, but was the first one with the idea and has already.

till identify as a design engineer. I guess the amazing part of my studies were that they really wanted you to take ownership of the whole process from spotting an issue, designing a product to building it.


I conceptualise, design and (sometimes) develop FELFEL products that you can interact with. This includes:

· The mobile app (iOS & Android) and our customer portal
· Our very exciting vending machines (FELFEL fridge + Gavetti coffee machine)

The largest split of the work is in UX and managing the roadmap, but I also actively design and develop both physical and digital components.
