I conceptualise, design and (sometimes) develop the part of FELFEL products that you can interact with. This includes:

· The mobile app (iOS & Android) and our customer portal
· Our very exciting vending machines (FELFEL fridge + Gavetti coffee machine)

The largest split of the work is in UX and managing the roadmap, but I also actively design and develop both physical and digital components.
