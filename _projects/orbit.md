OrBit is a **motion-sensing device for musicians and performers**. It bridges the gap between acoustic and digital music by **connecting you to your favourite digital effects and sounds**. Reverb, delay, pitch harmonisers, vocoders, all controlled with your movements.

This product was developed as part of an accelerator-style enterprise development module. **I pitched the business and led the team as CEO** from idea to preparing a full funding campaign. Check it out [here](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bitlabs/1326804002?ref=835107&token=2f7e4b06)!

My resposibilities were **project management, as well as hardware and software engineering**. In order to make the physical product more appealing, I also **built an app using React Native** that uses the smartphone sensors to showcase some features of OrBit. The sensor data from the phone was then interfaced with the digital audio workstation, via a node.js backend. The GitHub repository is available [here](https://github.com/pa17/bitlabs). 

Please have a look at the Kickstarter campaign to see how awesome OrBit is. For all you lazy visitors, I have put a **a lot of GIFs** in the gallery below.
