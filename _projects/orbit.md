OrBit is a **motion-sensing device for musicians and performers**. It bridges the gap between acoustic and digital music by **connecting you to your favourite digital effects and sounds**. Reverb, delay, pitch harmonisers, vocoders, all controlled with your movements.

This product was developed as part of an accelerator-style enterprise development module in my final year at university. **I pitched the business and led the team as CEO** from idea to preparing a full funding campaign. Check it out [here](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bitlabs/1326804002?ref=835107&token=2f7e4b06)!

My resposibilities included **project management and app development**. I was working on the desktop client that received sensor and control data from the device, and then relayed it to the digital audio workstation. Furthermore, I  **built a React Native app** that mimicked the physical product in order to showcase the features of OrBit using smartphone sensors and a node.js backend.

Please have a look at the Kickstarter campaign to see how awesome OrBit could be. For all you lazy visitors, I have put a **a lot of GIFs** in the gallery below.
