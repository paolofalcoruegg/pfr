I met Shey (sosafresh.com) at the *Queen Elisabeth Prize for Engineering* awards, which Gravity Sketch was nominated for. One thing led to another and **I joined the startup for a couple of weeks over summer**, before starting my second year at university. Gravity Sketch is the **first mixed reality 3D creation tool designed from the ground up for touch and gesture input**. They are striving to make digital 3D creation easier for designers, artists, and makers alike.

I worked mainly on **content creation for their upcoming Kickstarter campaign**, creating animations, clips and (video / VR) renders. Furthermore, I worked with their **app for Vive and Oculus**, which allows for an extremely immersive 3D creation experience. This was pretty early in my studies and I did not have the skills back then to work on the core functionality. Instead, I got some valuable insights into the field of VR, familiarised myself with Unity, and helped with launching the campaign.
