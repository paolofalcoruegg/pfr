I met Shey (sosafresh.com) at the *Queen Elisabeth Prize for Engineering* awards, which Gravity Sketch was nominated for. One thing led to another and **I joined the startup over summer**, before starting my second year at university. Gravity Sketch is the **first mixed reality 3D creation tool designed from the ground up for touch and gesture input**. They are striving to make digital 3D creation easier for designers, artists, and makers alike.

On the one hand, I worked on **content creation for their upcoming Kickstarter campaign**, creating animations, clips and (video / VR) renders. On the other hand, I was helping with implementing the 3D user interface and the physical gestures that allowed users to control their immersive software. The resulting product is an **app for Vive and Oculus**, which allows for an extremely immersive 3D creation experience. Over the course of the internship I got some valuable insights into the field of VR, was able to produce first work with Unity, and helped with launching the campaign.
