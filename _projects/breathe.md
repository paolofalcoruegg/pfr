**Disclaimer: This is the work of [breathe](https://breathe-ventilator.ch).**

breathe is an ETH spinoff company that I have been supporting on a voluntary basis, because I think their product is so powerful and could have a big impact on many people. As shown in quote below above, they are creating an affordable ventilator for use in less economically powerful countries.

I've been helping with setting up an interactive knowledge base, which is where medical professionals and technicians find the information on how to use, repair and maintain the device. Check out the video below to learn more about the company â€“ or visit [their website](https://breathe-ventilator.ch).

> The goal of the breathe project is to develop a low-cost, high-quality emergency and transport ventilator for use in low-resource settings.
