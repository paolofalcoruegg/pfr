Luna aims to improve **access to fresh and healthy food for night workers**. Thanks to recent investments in services such as the night tube, London's night economy is now estimated to be worth £26bn. However, this population is critically underserved in terms of access to food services as most operate during the day only. This design-led innovation project revolved around the need for a more diverse food offering for night workers in London.

The proposed service provides a platform that connects users to food vans. The core idea is that **users bid for a food van to come to their area at whatever time they want to eat**. The caterer sets a minimum number of orders and, as soon as this threshold is reached, signs up to deliver the meals in the specified slot. This voting system gives users a democratic choice over what food they want to eat, whilst ensuring that the caterer has financial certainty about how many meals can be sold. It supports both workers and consumers in hours where food availability is scarce and variety is low. A mobile application stands at the centre of the service proposal, allowing both consumers and food providers to link up.

**Luna aims to strengthen communities and local vendors in a socially responsible way**. Revenue is generated through a fee-based model, where a percentage of every transaction is used to fund the service. Please see some interaction prototypes in the video above and the project report below.

This was a very pure, user-centred design project. There was almost no development apart from the interaction prototypes; instead, we did huge amounts of user research and tried to nail the service offering.
