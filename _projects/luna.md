**Luna ensures that everybody has access to fresh food**, regardless of what time their work starts. This design project revolved around **the need for a more diverse food offering for night workers in London**. Thanks to recent investments in services such as the night tube, London's **night economy is now estimated to be worth £26bn**.

The service provides **a platform that connects people and food vans**. The core idea is that **users bid for a food van to come to their area at whatever time they want to eat**. The caterer sets a minimum number of orders and, as soon as this threshold is reached, signs up to deliver the meals in the specified slot. This voting system gives users **a democratic choice over what food they want to eat, whilst ensuring that the caterer has financial certainty about how many meals can be sold**. It supports both workers and consumers in hours where food availability is scarce and variety is low. A mobile application stands at the centre of the service proposal, allowing both consumers and providers to link up.

**Luna aims to strengthen communities and local vendors in a socially responsible way**. Revenue is generated through a fee-based model, where a percentage of every transaction is used to fund the service. Please see some interaction prototypes in the video above and the project report below.

This was a very pure, user-centred design project. There was almost no development apart from the interaction prototypes; instead, we did huge amounts of user research and tried to nail the service offering.
