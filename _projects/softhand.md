> Whether grasping, holding or turning, touching, typing or pressing â€“ in everyday life, we use our hands for the most diverse tasks. The human hand is a true miracle of nature. What could be more logical than equipping robots in collaborative working spaces with a gripper that is based on this natural model and can learn through artificial intelligence to solve a wide variety of gripping and turning tasks?

Bionic Soft Hand was the main project I was involved in at FESTO Bionics. My focus was  **developing a sensing system for the soft robotic hand in order to build advanced interactions such as teleoperation**. I conceptualised and developed three iterations of wearable sensor gloves that could determine the current pose of the hand. My early-stage prototypes were later miniaturised and incorporated into the hand. Meanwhile, I was able to use the sensor glove to prototype physical interactions with the robotic hand based on human input i.e. hand movements.

Using the data from the sensor glove I designed, I implemented a **digital twin of the physical hand (visualisation) wearing the glove** as well as **PID position control and teleoperation of the Bionic Soft Hand**. The robot hand was running on ROS, so the bulk of the code was written in Python and C++. Unfortunately, I had to return return to university before the project was completed, but left the team with a thorough documentation of my work and code. Other things I contributed to included:

* Working with TensorFlow to teach the hand movement patterns.
* PCB design and manufacture using EAGLE
* Data collection using my sensor system for subsequent reinforcement learning
