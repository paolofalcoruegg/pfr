This was the main project I was involved in at FESTO Bionics. My focus was  **developing an IMU sensing system for the soft robotic hand and implementing physical interactions such as teleoperation**. I conceptualised and developed three iterations of wearable sensor gloves that could determine the current pose of the hand. These early-stage prototypes were later miniaturised and incorporated into the hand. The bulk of the work, however, was **building software on top of sensor system**.

> "Whether grasping, holding or turning, touching, typing or pressing â€“ in everyday life, we use our hands for the most diverse tasks. The human hand is a true miracle of nature. What could be more logical than equipping robots in collaborative working spaces with a gripper that is based on this natural model and can learn through artificial intelligence to solve a wide variety of gripping and turning tasks?"

In terms of software, I implemented a **'digital twin' of the physical hand (visualisation), PID position control and teleoperation**. The robot hand was running on ROS, so the bulk of the code was written in **Python and C++**. Unfortunately, I had to return return to university before the project was completed, but left the team with a thorough documentation of my work and code. Other things I contributed to included:

* Working with TensorFlow to teach the hand movement patterns.
* PCB design and manufacture using EAGLE
* Data collection using my sensor system for subsequent reinforcement learning
