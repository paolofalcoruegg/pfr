> "Whether grasping, holding or turning, touching, typing or pressing – in everyday life, we use our hands for the most diverse tasks. The human hand is a true miracle of nature. What could be more logical than equipping robots in collaborative working spaces with a gripper that is based on this natural model and can learn through artificial intelligence to solve a wide variety of gripping and turning tasks?"

This was the main project I was involved in at FESTO Bionics. My focus was on **developing the IMU sensing system for the soft robotic system and creating  physical interactions such as teleoperation**. I ideated and developed three iterations of wearable sensor gloves that could determine the state of the hand. These early-stage prototypes were later miniaturised and incorporated into the hand.

Apart from hardware development, my work consisted of **software engineering using Python and C++**. I implemented a **'digital twin' of the physical hand (visualisation), PID position control and teleoperation**. Unfortunately, I had to return return to university before the project was completed, but left the team with a thorough documentation of my work and code. Other things I contributed to included:

* State-of-the-art **machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow** to make the hand smart.
* **PCB design** and manufacture using EAGLE
* Data collection using my sensor system for **reinforcement learning**
